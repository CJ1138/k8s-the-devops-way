# K8s The Devops Way

PLEASE NOTE THIS REPO IS A WIP NOT YET IN A FULLY FUNCTIONING STATE

An fully automated deployment of Kelsey Hightowers's "Kubernetes The Hard Way" tutorial. Created for my own learning purposes, the intention is to extend the purpose of the origin tutorial (understanding each task required to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster) by additionally demonstrating how to do that with automation and monitoring tools.
